- **Compliance & Documentation** (Policy search, audit preparation, regulatory compliance)

## Setup Instructions

**Modular Setup**: The RCM demo environment is created with 6 sequential scripts:

1. **Run the setup scripts in order**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute each script in Snowflake worksheet in sequence:
   
   -- Part 1: Data Model and Infrastructure
   /sql_scripts/01_rcm_data_setup.sql
   
   -- Part 2: Create Healthcare Documents
   /sql_scripts/02_rcm_documents_setup.sql
   
   -- Part 3: Generate Synthetic Healthcare Data  
   /sql_scripts/03_rcm_data_generation.sql
   
   -- Part 4: Healthcare Semantic Views
   /sql_scripts/04_rcm_semantic_views.sql
   
   -- Part 5: Document Intelligence Search Services
   /sql_scripts/05_rcm_cortex_search.sql
   
   -- Part 6: RCM AI Agent Configuration
   /sql_scripts/06_rcm_agent_setup.sql
   ```

2. **What the scripts create**:
   - `SF_INTELLIGENCE_DEMO` role and `RCM_INTELLIGENCE_WH` warehouse
   - `RCM_AI_DEMO.RCM_SCHEMA` database and schema
   - **Self-contained demo** with no external dependencies
   - **10 healthcare dimension tables** (providers, payers, procedures, diagnoses, etc.)
   - **4 fact tables** (claims, denials, payments, encounters) with 50,000+ records
   - **8+ healthcare policy documents** embedded in the database
   - **2 RCM-specific semantic views** for Cortex Analyst
   - **5 healthcare document search services** for Cortex Search
   - **Healthcare market intelligence functions** with external access
   - **1 specialized RCM AI agent** (`RCM_Healthcare_Agent`)

3. **Post-Setup Verification**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify components
   SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA RCM_AI_DEMO.RCM_SCHEMA;
   SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA RCM_AI_DEMO.RCM_SCHEMA;
   SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES IN SCHEMA RCM_AI_DEMO.RCM_SCHEMA;
